# Operating Systems Coursework - RESITS

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Operating Systems coursework for RESITS, including:

- Worksheet 1: Assembly programming tasks (echo of assembler)
- Worksheet 2 Part 1: TinyOS bootloader and basic kernel
- Worksheet 2 Part 2: Interrupt system and keyboard handling

## Build Environment
- Target: Linux/CSCT Cloud environment
- Tools: GCC, NASM, Make, QEMU
- Architecture: 32-bit x86

```

## Testing Instructions

### Worksheet 1 (Assembly)
```bash
cd "OS WORKSHEET 1/os task/task 1"
make clean && make all
make run-task1  # Test task 1
make run-task2  # Test task 2

cd "../tasks2"
make clean && make program
make run        # Test integrated program
```

### Worksheet 2 (TinyOS)
```bash
cd "OS WORKSHEET 2/os task 2/TinyOS"
make clean && make all
make run        # Boot in QEMU (if available)
```

## Implemented Features

### Worksheet 1
- Fixed makefile auto-execution issues
- Corrected input validation in range_sum.asm
- Integrated driver.c with assembly functions

### Worksheet 2
- Complete interrupt descriptor table (IDT)
- PIC controller setup and configuration
- Keyboard input handling with scan code mapping
- Assembly interrupt handlers
- Enhanced framebuffer system with color support
- Proper kernel initialization sequence

## Status
Ready for testing in CSCT Cloud Linux environment.
